# Design

## Color Scheme

I want to keep it simple yet elegent hence used the combination of Black & White with grey color when customer hover over any clickable link/option. But all different kind of colorful imagery on the website of different phulkari products add its own charm to whole website and it doesn't look monotonoes at all due to that.

## Typography

**Lato** font is the major font used in this website for all kind of text with fallback option to **sans-serif** if the browser don't support the preffered color Lato.

## Agile Methodology

Agile project management principles guided the development of this project, leveraging GitHub Projects as the primary software for tracking user stories. Utilizing the Kanban board task view, I crafted a comprehensive user story template that served as the foundation for all project-related narratives. Beyond capturing the core user stories, GitHub Projects played a pivotal role in efficiently monitoring and addressing bugs identified throughout the project's lifecycle. Screenshot added below to give an over all view of the board and all user stories I worked on along with the template I used to create user stories.

## Future Features

- Asynchronous behaviour
    - When a query or answer submitted once but if the page is refreshed the same query or answer gets re-submitted. A future feature is planned to avoid resubmitting it and clear out the page when these actions are taken by the user.

- Profile image upload by the user
    - When a user try to create its profile. Currently the profile image upload option is given but its not working and the site user is not able to load the profile image by itself. Only the admin can do it on the users behalf. Hence, in future release this bug is planned to fix.

- Further relevant feedback
    - Implement autohide notifications.
    - Implement like, upvote feature on queries and answers.
    - Implement edit query feature.
    - Implement a user can see all its queries and answer from a single profile page too.
    - Implement all profile page where a user can see breif profile info about other users too like how many query they have asked or answer they have given. What feilds they are expert of etc.,

4. Select the region your are working in. 

### External Database Setup

I used [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) as my database. 

1. Login or create an account. 
2. In dashboard on the right top corner click `Create New Instance`
3. You will be forward to a `Select a plan and name`:
    - `Name` should be the name of the project
    - `Plan` should be the type of subscription you have with ElephantSQL, in my case I used the `Tiny Turtle (Free)` plan.
    - `Tags` can be left in blank
Then click on `Select Region`.

4. Here selecte your `Data center`. This is hosted with AWS. In my case due to my location I used `EU-North-1 (Stockholm)`. Please note that you should select an AWS Availability Zone (AZ) closest where your main users will be located to reduce downtime. Then click `Review`.
5. Here you will check the name, cloud provider and region where the application will be hosted. If, everything is correct, click `Create instance`.
6. Go to dashboard and your instance will be there. Click in the name and under `Details` copy the `URL`, this will be values that will be needed for the [Heroku variables setup](#heroku-settings) and the [env.py](#envpy-file-set-up) file.

### External Storage Setup

I used [Cloudinary](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-24efd5faa3f26bc4dbe6b501d1a6e8/media_library/search?q=&view_mode=mosaic) as cloud storage for this project. 

1. Create and account or login. 
2. Go to `Dashboard` and copy the `API Environment variable`.
3. This URL will be required when setting up the [env.py](#envpy-file-set-up) and the [Heroku variables](#heroku-settings). 

### env.py File Setup

1. In the root directory of your project create a new file called `env.py`.
2. Add this `env.py` file to your `.gitignore` file so the confidential information in the file is not push to Github.
3. In the `env.py` file import the `os` module and add the [database URL](#external-database-set-up).

```
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURL>"
```

4. Then, using the same process create a `SECRET_KEY`. This can be anything, I used [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) to create a complicated key. 

```
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="<copiedGeneratedKEY>"
```

5. Then, using the same process, in the `env.py` file import the `os` module and add the [storageURL](#external-storage-set-up).

```
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="<copiedCloudinaryURL>"
```

6. Save the file.

### Heroku Settings 

After the application is created in Heroku. Got to your dashboard and you will see the application name, click on it and then follow the following: 

1. Go to the settings tab and go to `ConfigVars` and click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables: 
    - Key: `PORT`, Value: `8000`
    - Key: `DATABASE_URL`, Value: [databaseURL](#external-database-set-up)
    - Key: `CLOUDINARY_URL`, Value [storageURL](#external-storage-set-up)
    - Key: `SECRET_KEY`, Value: [randomKey](#envpy-file-set-up)

2. After setting up the variables, go to `Buildpacks` and select `Python`.

### Heroku Deployment 

1. Go to `Deploy` tab and under `Deployment method` connect to the Github repository.
2. Then there can be two options: manual or automatic deployment. 
    - Manual deployment means that it will be necessary to go to Heroku and deploy the application each time that changes are made. 
    - Automatic deployment will re-deploy the application each time new code is pushed to Github. 
3. After selecting the deployment method, under `Manual Deployment` click `Deploy branch`.

## Design

The site type was a mixed between a reddit and quora kind of websites. The following sites were used for instpiration: 

- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) 

Additionally, the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) framework was heavily used for the front-end development.

## Code

Honestly, if I have to admit then this was the toughest project for me till date. The more control moved out of my hand to in the hand of templates it become difficult to control initially. But day by day, gradually I started getting hold of it and have better understanding that how the things are flowing. Though, there is still a lot to learn but I would thanks first everyone who helped me during this projects journey.

So, out of many chanllenges I faced to handle all of them a thumb rule I kept on working is to align with Code Institute Developing with Django (I Think Therefore I Blog) and it has been the biggest help for me in the journey.

Apart from this I faced a challenge regarding how to generate auto slug as I was providing the authenticated site users to post the query. Hence the slug was required to generate dynamically. Here I received the help from [Learn Django](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-slug-tutorial) tutorial. It helped me to understand and fix the challenge.

Next challenge for me was to display multiple views on the same page and here I found help from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48729966/how-can-i-call-multiple-views-in-one-url-address-in-django) community and able to resolve the issue.

Thereafter another hurdle I faced is to how to make some fields readonly at the admin side. Hence, I again visited to look for some django books or material that might Phulkari World. My search ends at [Agiliq](https://books.agiliq.com/projects/django-admin-cookbook/en/latest/changeview_readonly.html).

I also faced one big challenge during this project is my loss of database a few days back. I initially started development on Code anywhere as that was the only framework I was using till date since I started my learning. But, with Django it was not behaving well and since last month or so, it was doomed. My ship was sinking with it. But then GitPod comes to my rescue and it has been blessings as Git pod is working seamllessely with Git hub and heroku.

But, in the meantime, my database got damaged and I have to take help from CI Tutor support to understand the reason some of my code was not working and they explained me that it was due to database damaged and then I have reset my whole database and update fresh data of users, queries and answers.

In this project I also found good help from my mentor Martina, slack communities too.

In the end, I would like to mention that the queries and answers I have picked directly from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) & [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) rather then creating on my own to save time. Some of the queries and answers are a bit modified as well to suite the website behavior. Apart from this I have used Microsoft Co-pilot to generate imaginary description text of About Us page as well as for different users profile.
